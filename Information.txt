Rent a Plane

My vision for this project is to increase the availability of general aviation aircraft to rent. I believe there are thousands of planes sitting in hangars around the country that are not being used fully by their owners, and that the owners would like to recoup some of the costs that come with owning an airplane. There are more formal channels of renting airplanes like the Fixed Based Operators at airports, and flight schools, but there is no way for an individual to market his or her own aircraft. I would like to model this company a little bit like Air bnb, with members earning positive or negative feeback based on their renting habits and training history. I envision my company providing the necessary commercial insurance required to rent airplanes in exchange for a fee for each rental transaction performed. 

I personally want this idea to succeed because I was discouraged by the lack of light sport airplanes available to rent while I was training for my pilot's license. Airplanes are much more expensive than an average car, and usually get less usage than a car, so they are not affordable for a majority of pilots. I would love if something like this was already in the market because I love airplanes and aviation, and I would take advantage of the convenience and affordability as much as possible. I am always thinking about flying and participating on pilot forums, and this issue of affordability and lack of access is a very common theme. Test info
